just my husband and i here but we decided that we wanted to build a sun room&quot;, [&quot;statement-non-opinion&quot;, [0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0]]], [&quot;B&quot;, &quot;and it&#39;s a good thing we got a

0.088, 0.4404]]], [&quot;B&quot;, &quot;the contractor saying one thing and then doing another and anyway we ended up with a really neat sun room on the back of the house it&#39;s beautiful it&#39;s like two hundred square foot&quot;, [&quot;statement-non-opinion&quot;, [0.0, 0.756, 0.244, 0.8655]]], [&quot;B&quot;, &quot;but that&#39;s not something we did by ourselves if you talk about home

you do&quot;, [&quot;statement-opinion&quot;, [0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0]]], [&quot;B&quot;, &quot;oh i know because every time they send somebody out they have to take them off a crew that&#39;s making

thing&quot;, [&quot;statement-non-opinion&quot;, [0.0, 0.888, 0.112, 0.6597]]], [&quot;B&quot;, &quot;so that was kind of interesting&quot;, [&quot;statement-non-opinion&quot;, [0.0, 0.675, 0.325, 0.3415]]], [&quot;A&quot;, &quot;yeah they i like when they come in of course i designed my own house i&#39;m i i&#39;ve had prior experience in design and building and stuff like that so i know basically if it&#39;s done right the problem is i don&#39;t want to do anymore&quot;, [&quot;statement-non-opinion&quot;, [0.083, 0.764, 0.153, 0.507]]], [&quot;B&quot;, &quot;oh neat&quot;,

&quot;yeah well we&#39;ve taken this another step further this year we&#39;re going to build a deck we&#39;ve got some people building a deck out in the back you know to complete sort of the back yard kind of thing and&quot;, [&quot;statement-non-opinion&quot;, [0.0, 0.893, 0.107, 0.5106]]], [&quot;A&quot;, &quot;well i could recommend something there if you know if it&#39;s not just cost

&quot;regular just treated pine&quot;, [&quot;statement-non-opinion&quot;, [0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0]]], [&quot;A&quot;, &quot;kind of a womanized pine and then i spray treated it with some&quot;,

you have to do about every two years&quot;, [&quot;statement-non-opinion&quot;, [0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0]]], [&quot;B&quot;, &quot;okay&quot;, [&quot;acknowledge_(backchannel)&quot;, [0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.2263]]], [&quot;A&quot;, &quot;the problem with that is it warps after a couple of years then and you have to start replacing boards&quot;, [&quot;statement-opinion&quot;, [0.13, 0.87, 0.0, -0.4019]]], [&quot;B&quot;, &quot;i was wondering about that yeah&quot;, [&quot;statement-non-opinion&quot;, [0.0, 0.645, 0.355, 0.296]]], [&quot;A&quot;, &quot;the second time i did it out of cedar which i soaked in thompson water seal&quot;, [&quot;statement-non-opinion&quot;, [0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0]]], [&quot;B&quot;, &quot;uh-huh&quot;, [&quot;acknowledge_(backchannel)&quot;, [0.0, 1.0, 0.0,

it&quot;, [&quot;abandoned_or_turn-exit/uninterpretable&quot;, [0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0]]], [&quot;B&quot;, &quot;oh yeah&quot;, [&quot;acknowledge_(backchannel)&quot;, [0.0, 0.313, 0.688, 0.296]]], [&quot;A&quot;, &quot;you know the sun and everything else it just makes it look gray and dull an and it doesn&#39;t look attractive after a few years the wood lasts fine but the color i was real dissatisfied&quot;, [&quot;statement-non-opinion&quot;, [0.181, 0.782, 0.037, -0.676]]], [&quot;B&quot;, &quot;the color is what you&#39;re yeah sometimes after&quot;, [&quot;statement-non-opinion&quot;, [0.0, 0.761, 0.239, 0.296]]], [&quot;A&quot;, &quot;and if you can stand the additional expense which you&#39;ll recoup after a while because it will last forever is the redwood if you&#39;ll go with the redwood&quot;, [&quot;statement-opinion&quot;, [0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0]]], [&quot;A&quot;, &quot;they&#39;re screws the self adhesive screws all right&quot;, [&quot;statement-opinion&quot;, [0.4, 0.6, 0.0, -0.4588]]], [&quot;B&quot;, &quot;yeah those and so they&#39;re not going to split and i was really concerned about bugs really when i when we were considering other types of wood because you know termites can be a real hazard around here&quot;, [&quot;statement-non-opinion&quot;, [0.0, 0.939, 0.061, 0.296]]], [&quot;A&quot;, &quot;you have to pretty much spray them regularly you know under an and around or whatever so you want to leave yourself enough space to get under it or be able to lift it up&quot;, [&quot;statement-non-opinion&quot;, [0.032, 0.843, 0.126, 0.5542]]], [&quot;B&quot;, &quot;yeah&quot;, [&quot;acknowledge_(backchannel)&quot;, [0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.296]]], [&quot;A&quot;, &quot;on some ends a lot of times they won&#39;t even detach them to the ground they just lay them up on some cinder blocks underneath in the ground&quot;, [&quot;statement-non-opinion&quot;, [0.068, 0.932, 0.0, -0.2263]]], [&quot;B&quot;, &quot;um-hum&quot;, [&quot;abandoned_or_turn-exit/uninterpretable&quot;, [0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0]]], [&quot;A&quot;, &quot;and they&#39;re heavy enough where they won&#39;t the wind won&#39;t pick them up or they won&#39;t shift if it&#39;s big enough and heavy enough&quot;, [&quot;statement-non-opinion&quot;, [0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0]]], [&quot;A&quot;, &quot;so they&#39;re several ways of doing it but the redwood is by far the best and i would and i would also insist on that they do treat that with thompson&#39;s water seal&quot;, [&quot;statement-non-opinion&quot;, [0.0, 0.756, 0.244, 0.8847]]], [&quot;B&quot;, &quot;that&quot;, [&quot;abandoned_or_turn-exit/uninterpretable&quot;, [0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0]]], [&quot;B&quot;, &quot;yeah that&#39;s the end part that&#39;s where you know get the&quot;, [&quot;statement-non-opinion&quot;, [0.0, 0.82, 0.18, 0.296]]], [&quot;B&quot;, &quot;that&#39;s the part we have to do we got that up front we figured it out you know we need to know what we need to do that&#39;s not included in this and that&#39;s one of the details but that&#39;s fine as long as they tell you&quot;, [&quot;statement-opinion&quot;, [0.0, 0.954, 0.046, 0.296]]],

[&quot;B&quot;, &quot;it&#39;s so funny because tom is getting more and more adept at doing things it&#39;s just things like painting just always used to really scare me he didn&#39;t know where to start you know with a paint can you know an&quot;, [&quot;statement-non-opinion&quot;, [0.076, 0.801, 0.123, 0.296]]], [&quot;A&quot;, &quot;well it is it&#39;s a frightening experience&quot;, [&quot;statement-opinion&quot;, [0.344, 0.43, 0.226, -0.2732]]], [&quot;A&quot;, &quot;the one thing you might do if he will deliver the boards that he is going to make the under structure with&quot;,

&quot;on those and then when he cuts them and puts them together then that&#39;ll already be treated and a fast way of doing that if you&#39;ll go get a piece of guttering material like a little trough&quot;, [&quot;statement-non-opinion&quot;, [0.06, 0.872, 0.068, 0.0772]]], [&quot;B&quot;, &quot;uh-huh&quot;, [&quot;acknowledge_(backchannel)&quot;, [0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0]]], [&quot;A&quot;,

got you covered there&quot;, [&quot;statement-non-opinion&quot;, [0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0]]], [&quot;A&quot;, &quot;pour that in pour the thompson&#39;s water seal in there and then just put that in there and turn them over several times and let them set and soak in&quot;, [&quot;statement-non-opinion&quot;, [0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0]]], [&quot;A&quot;, &quot;that&#39;s right that works wonders it i know it

happens if they aren&#39;t water sealed&quot;, [&quot;statement-non-opinion&quot;, [0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0]]], [&quot;A&quot;, &quot;well over a period of time any lumber will deteriorate&quot;, [&quot;statement-non-opinion&quot;, [0.0, 0.792, 0.208, 0.2732]]], [&quot;B&quot;, &quot;yeah will deteriorate yeah&quot;, [&quot;acknowledge_(backchannel)&quot;, [0.0, 0.313, 0.688, 0.5267]]],
